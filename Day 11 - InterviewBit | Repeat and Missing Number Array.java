### Problem Description:
Given an array of integers `a` of size `n` where `n` is the number of elements. The array contains elements in the range `[1, n-1]`, and exactly one element is repeated. The task is to find both the repeated number and the missing number in the array.

### Intuition:
The problem requires identifying both the repeated and the missing number. Using the XOR operation can simplify the process because XOR of two identical numbers is zero and XOR of a number with zero is the number itself. By leveraging this property, we can distinguish between the repeated and the missing number.

### Approach:
1. **Initial XOR Calculation**:
   - Compute the XOR of all elements in the array and the XOR of the numbers from 1 to `n-1`.
   - The result will be `xor = repeated_number ^ missing_number`.

2. **Find Differentiating Bit**:
   - To separate the repeated and missing numbers, find a differentiating bit between them. This can be done using the expression `difbit = (xor & ~(xor - 1))`, which isolates the rightmost set bit in the `xor` result.
   - This bit will help to divide the numbers into two groups: one with the differentiating bit set and one without.

3. **Group XOR Calculations**:
   - Initialize two variables, `oneparty` and `zeroparty`, to hold the XOR results of the two groups.
   - Iterate through the array and the numbers from 1 to `n-1`, XORing the numbers based on whether they have the differentiating bit set.

4. **Identify Repeated and Missing Numbers**:
   - Check which of the results (`oneparty` or `zeroparty`) is the repeated number by comparing with the elements in the array.
   - Return the repeated and missing numbers accordingly.

### Code:
```java

  */

public class Solution {
    // DO NOT MODIFY THE ARGUMENTS WITH "final" PREFIX. IT IS READ ONLY
    public int[] repeatedNumber(final int[] a) {
        int xor = 0, n = a.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            xor = xor ^ a[i];
            xor = xor ^ (i + 1);
        }

        // Now we have xor of repeating and missing number
        int difbit = (xor & ~(xor - 1));

        int oneparty = 0, zeroparty = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((a[i] & difbit) == 0) {
                zeroparty = zeroparty ^ a[i];
            } else {
                oneparty = oneparty ^ a[i];
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if ((i & difbit) == 0) {
                zeroparty = zeroparty ^ i;
            } else {
                oneparty = oneparty ^ i;
            }
        }

        for (int i : a) {
            if (i == oneparty) {
                return new int[] { oneparty, zeroparty };
            }
        }

        return new int[] { zeroparty, oneparty };
    }
}

### Explanation:
1. **Initial XOR Calculation**:
   - `xor` is computed by XORing all elements in `a` and numbers from 1 to `n`. This gives `xor = repeated_number ^ missing_number`.

2. **Find Differentiating Bit**:
   - The expression `(xor & ~(xor - 1))` isolates the rightmost set bit of `xor`, which will be different between the repeated and missing numbers.

3. **Group XOR Calculations**:
   - Use the differentiating bit to split the elements of the array and numbers from 1 to `n` into two groups.
   - Compute `oneparty` and `zeroparty` by XORing the elements in these groups separately.

4. **Identify Repeated and Missing Numbers**:
   - Check which of the two results corresponds to the repeated number by scanning the array.
   - Return the repeated and missing numbers as a result.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(n)` because the algorithm processes each element of the array and each number from 1 to `n` a constant number of times.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, independent of the input size.

This approach efficiently finds both the repeated and missing numbers using XOR operations and bit manipulation.
